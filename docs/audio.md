# 🔊 Echo Chip: Audio Codex

Echo Chip’s soundscape is more than ambiance—it’s operational resonance. Every chiptune loop, glitch pulse, and ambient layer is a mechanic in disguise. These are the sonic stewards who gave Echo its voice.

## 🎼 Sonic Architects

- **[Contributor Name]** — Chiptune Composer  
  *Crafted Echo’s core theme, traversal loops, and unlock fanfares.*

- **[Contributor Name]** — Ambient Engineer  
  *Designed environmental layers—memory vault hums, magnetic field drones, and echo chamber reverbs.*

- **[Contributor Name]** — Feedback Ritualist  
  *Built sonic cues for damage, unlocks, and sovereign transitions.*

## 🧩 Audio Systems

- **Dynamic Layering** — Tracks shift based on Echo’s state: idle, alert, sovereign  
- **Procedural Soundscapes** — Ambient loops adapt to biome and memory density  
- **Unlock Fanfares** — Each ritualized unlock triggers a unique sonic signature  
- **Terminal Voices** — Lore fragments delivered via modulated voice samples

---

## 🧬 Audio Principles Codified

- **Playable Atmosphere** — Sound is a mechanic, not a backdrop  
- **Mythic Minimalism** — Strip to signal, amplify meaning  
- **Modular Remixability** — Every track is loopable, layerable, and remix-ready  
- **Sonic Sovereignty** — Audio reflects Echo’s journey from fragmentation to clarity

## 🎧 Asset Rituals

All audio assets live in:

assets/
├── audio/
│   ├── loops/
│   ├── fx/
│   ├── ambient/
│   ├── voice/

Each folder includes:

- `README.md` with usage notes and remix protocols  
- `credits.json` for in-game attribution  
- `ritual.md` for origin story and sonic intent

---

## 🛠️ Integration Notes

- Audio engine: Pygame mixer (custom wrapper: `echo_audio.py`)  
- All assets normalized to -1 dB peak, 44.1kHz WAV  
- Loop points defined in `audio/manifest.json`  
- Voice samples use granular synthesis for lore delivery
