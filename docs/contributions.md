# 🧠 Echo Chip: Contribution Codex

Welcome, builder. Echo Chip isn’t just a game—it’s a modular mythos. Every mechanic is a metaphor. Every commit is a ritual. If you're here, you're not just contributing code—you're shaping legacy.

## 🔧 What You Can Contribute

Echo Chip thrives on emergent systems and sovereign iteration. We welcome contributions across:

- **Code**: Gameplay mechanics, optimization, procedural generation
- **Art**: Pixel sprites, tilesets, VFX, UI elements
- **Audio**: Chiptune loops, sonic feedback, ambient layers
- **Narrative**: Lore fragments, faction logs, terminal entries
- **Design**: Puzzle architecture, level chunks, boss mechanics
- **Docs**: README updates, mechanic bibles, lore scaffolding

## 🛠️ Dev Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/echo-chip
cd echo-chip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

> Requires Python 3.9+ and Pygame 2.1.3+

## 🧙 Rituals of Contribution

We treat every contribution as a sovereign artifact. Here’s how to join the build:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Your fork is your domain—experiment freely.

2. **Create a Feature Branch**  
   Use clear, modular naming: `feature/magnetic-puzzle`, `fix/echolocation-radius`

3. **Document Your Intent**  
   Every PR must include a `ritual.md`:
   - What problem does this solve?
   - What system does it touch?
   - What future remix does it enable?

4. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   Include screenshots, test notes, and your `ritual.md`. We review for clarity, modularity, and mythic alignment.

## 🧩 Design Principles

- **Modularity First**: Every system should be remixable.
- **Emergence Over Control**: Build for surprise, not rigidity.
- **Mythic Minimalism**: Strip away noise—leave only signal.
- **Playable Philosophy**: Mechanics should reflect meaning.

---

## 🧬 Coding Standards

- Pythonic clarity > cleverness
- Comment with intent, not apology
- Use docstrings for all public functions
- Follow PEP8 unless myth demands otherwise

---

## 🧠 Documentation Rituals

- Every new mechanic deserves a `docs/mechanics/` entry
- Every new lore fragment belongs in `docs/fragments/`
- Every system update should be reflected in `docs/systems/`

---

## 🧙 Sovereign Stewardship

Echo Chip is designed for inheritance. Your contribution isn’t just a patch—it’s a protocol others will build upon. Treat your work as a legacy artifact.
